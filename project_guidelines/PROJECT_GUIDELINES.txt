Stageplan & Inputlist Generator – Project Guidelines

This document defines the goals, rules, and workflow of the Stageplan & Inputlist Generator project.
Technical and architectural details are intentionally kept minimal here and are described in separate documents.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Project Goal
--------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to automate the creation of a stageplan and input list for a band
and eliminate manual editing in Word documents.

From predefined presets (band → lineup → musicians), the application must generate,
in a single step, a clean and professional document and export it to PDF
with a fixed layout (A4, exactly one page).

Main benefits:
- time savings
- elimination of common errors (duplicate inputs, wrong numbering)
- consistent and professional output for sound engineers and promoters

--------------------------------------------------
2. Core Principles
--------------------------------------------------

- Single source of truth
  Inputs, monitors, and stage requirements are defined once in presets.

- Automation over manual editing
  Manual overrides are allowed only as an exception.

- Predictable output
  Same inputs always produce the same layout.

- Local-first
  The application works locally; online mode is optional.

- No overengineering
  MVP uses structured JSON files, no database.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Application Output
--------------------------------------------------

- Format: PDF
- Page size: A4
- Pages: exactly 1
  - Exception: Inputlist PDF export MAY be 2 pages when Stageplan is included as page 2.
    Stageplan is always page 2, never page 1.
- Document language: English
- Limits:
  - max 32 input channels
  - max 6 monitor / IEM mixes

Filename format:
[BAND_CODE]_Stageplan_Inputlist_DD_MM_YYYY.pdf

--------------------------------------------------
4. User Workflow
--------------------------------------------------

1. Select band (default: Couple of Sounds)
2. Enter event date (required)
3. Optionally enter venue
4. Review or override contact details
5. Select lineup and musician presets
6. Automatic generation of:
   - input list
   - monitor / IEM table
   - stageplan boxes
7. Validation
8. PDF export

--------------------------------------------------
5. Fixed Groups and Ordering
--------------------------------------------------

The following groups are fixed and ordered:

1. drums
2. bass
3. guitar
4. keys
5. vocs
6. talkback

This order is used for:
- input list sorting
- stageplan box ordering
- automatic channel numbering

--------------------------------------------------
6. Musician Presets
--------------------------------------------------

Each musician has one or more presets representing their typical setup.

A preset defines:
- input channels (with unique technical keys)
- default monitor / IEM requirements
- the group the preset belongs to

Rules:
- input keys must be globally unique within a project
- presets are the primary data source
- projects only assemble existing presets

--------------------------------------------------
7. Monitors / IEM
--------------------------------------------------

Monitor requirements are part of musician presets.

The project may:
- use preset defaults
- override them if required (e.g. IEM → wedge)

The monitor table is generated automatically from the final lineup.

--------------------------------------------------
8. Stageplan
--------------------------------------------------

The stageplan is generated automatically.

Each group is represented by a single box containing:
- assigned input channels (with channel numbers)
- monitor / IEM summary
- optional technical notes

Manual drag & drop positioning is not part of MVP,
but the architecture must allow it in the future.

--------------------------------------------------
9. Validation Before Export
--------------------------------------------------

PDF export is allowed only if:
- required data is present (band, date)
- no input key is duplicated
- input count ≤ 25
- monitor count ≤ 6

If validation fails, export is blocked and a clear error message is shown.

--------------------------------------------------
10. Related Project Documents
--------------------------------------------------

- Architecture and code quality rules:
  See ARCHITECTURE.txt

- Reference layouts and expected outputs:
  See files prefixed with VZOR_*

- ARCHITECTURE.txt is the authoritative source for all architectural and code-quality decisions.

--------------------------------------------------
11. Scope and Future Extensions
--------------------------------------------------

The architecture accounts for future extensions such as:
- database storage
- multi-page exports
- drag & drop stageplan
- additional export formats

These features are explicitly out of scope for MVP.
